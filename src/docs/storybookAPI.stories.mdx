# Storybook API reference

GreyVest's documentation is written using Storybook 5.2's [Docs addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/docspage.md) with stories in [CSF format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df).

CSF stories declare a configuration object as their default export. The API looks like this:

```js
export default {
  title,
  component,
  decorators,
  parameters: {
    componentSubtitle,
    info,
    props,
    propGroups,
  },
}
```

### A note on customizations

Storybook docs are supposed to automatically parse PropTypes and JSDocs into data for the description and props table, but this is not ideal for us for two reasons:

1. Our widespread use of HOCs such as mobx-react's `observer` means that Storybook has trouble parsing metadata for a lot of our components (this will likely be ironed out as Storybook Docs matures, but we'd rather not wait for that to happen)
2. We haven't historically used PropTypes and would have to add the data in some format to each of our components or stories anyway - and for documentation only, using PropTypes is less flexible than manually specifying the arguments to PropTable

As a result, our storybook configuration is customized to pass the values from the `props` (or `propGroups`) and `info` properties in `parameters` directly into Storybook's PropsTable and Description components, respectively.

## Subtitle

`componentSubtitle` is a built-in Storybook property for the subtitle of a DocsPage. It supports JSX expressions.

### Example

```jsx
{
  componentSubtitle: <>
    Button with <tt>large</tt> and <tt>small</tt> variants
  </>
}
```

## Description

You can supply a description for the story with the `info` property. It takes only strings, but supports markdown formatting.

### Example

```js
{
  info: `
GreyVest's Button component features six styling variants: **primary**,
**secondary**, **danger**, **success**, **info**, and **ghost**. It also
supports two size variants, **small** and **large**. To specify a variant,
simply pass it as a flag to the component:

\`\`\`jsx
<Button primary small>I am a small primary button</Button>
\`\`\`
`
}
```

## Props

The `props` property accepts either a `{ [propName]: propDefinition }` object, or an array of `{ propName, ...propDefinition }` objects. This is passed to Storybook's Props component and eventually rendered into the props table that appears on a story's docs page. A prop definition has the following shape (see Storybook's [PropDef](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/lib/components/src/blocks/PropsTable/PropDef.ts) type for reference):

```ts
{
  required: boolean, // defaults to false
  type: string | { summary: string, detail?: string },
  description?: string,
  defaultValue?: string | { summary: string, detail?: string }
}
```

### Summary values

In addition to a string value, the `type` and `defaultValue` properties accept a `{ summary, detail }` object. This is the representation used by Storybook internally - the value of `summary` is displayed in the prop table, and the value of `detail`, if given, is displayed in a tooltip underneath. (If `type` or `defaultValue` receives a plain string instead of an object, it's used as the value of `summary` when passed to Storybook.)

### Groups

Storybook's props table supports either a single list of props, or multiple lists grouped into titled sections. For the latter, use the `propGroups` property instead of `props`, and pass an object of the form `{ [sectionTitle]: props }`.

### Example

```js
// Button.stories.js

let flagDef = { type: 'boolean', defaultValue: 'false' }

let propGroups = {
  flags: { small: flagDef, large: flagDef },
  other: {
    icon: {
      description: "supports the same values as Icon's `icon` prop",
      type: 'string | Component',
    },
    onClick: {
      description: 'click handler for button',
      type: 'function',
    },
  },
}

export default { title: 'Button', parameters: { propGroups } }

export let story = () => // ...
```

## Stories

Stories in CSF are simply named exports. You can customize individual stories by adding properties to the story object; `story.name` controls the title of the story in the sidebar, and `story.parameters.docs.storyDescription` allows you to add a description that appears above that story in the DocsPage.

```jsx
export let secondary = () => <Button secondary>Click me</Button>
secondary.story = {
  name: 'Secondary (default)',
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      storyDescription:
        'Since the secondary color variant is also the default styling for Button, it can be used with either `Button` or `Button.Secondary`.',
    },
  },
}
```
